# Fuzzy-SAC

## A project that optimize the fuzzy control method with deep reinforcement learning
Fuzzy control System is optimized with the assistance of neural network trained by reinforcement learning, and this method can be applied to real process and most of nonlinear control tasks.
## We use the following scenarios to certify our method:
Car-Following Problem

Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor(CSTR)

## The following algorithm is mentionded in this project:
### Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system

### Soft Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm

## The control effect can be viewed in the following GIFS:
### In Car-Following Problem:
