# Fuzzy-SAC

## A project that optimize the fuzzy control method with deep reinforcement learning
## Our method is optimized for fuzzy control, and reinforcement learning algorithm can be applied to real process.

## We use the following scenarios to certify our method:
### Car-Following Problem
### Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor(CSTR)

## We use the following algorithm:
### Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy inference system
### Soft Actor-Critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm
